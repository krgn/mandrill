-- |  Returns information about an export job. If the export job's state is 
-- 'complete', the returned data will include a URL you can use to fetch the 
-- results. Every export job produces a zip archive, but the format of the 
-- archive is distinct for each job type. The api calls that initiate exports 
-- include more details about the output format for that job type.

-- | Begins an export of your rejection blacklist. The blacklist will be 
-- exported to a zip archive containing a single file named rejects.csv that 
-- includes the following fields: email, reason, detail, created_at, 
-- expires_at, last_event_at, expires_at.

-- | Begins an export of your activity history. The activity will be exported 
-- to a zip archive containing a single file named activity.csv in the same 
-- format as you would be able to export from your account's activity view. It 
-- includes the following fields: Date, Email Address, Sender, Subject, Status, 
-- Tags, Opens, Clicks, Bounce Detail. If you have configured any custom metadata 
-- fields, they will be included in the exported data.
